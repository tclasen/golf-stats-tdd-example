XP == Test-First Development
Agile == Test-Driven Development

Feedback Loops:
- OODA == Observe Orient Decide Act
- PDCA == Plan, Do, Check, Act

SLDC:
- Plan
- Dev
- Test
- Release


Phases of TDD:
- Red
- Green
- Blue (Refactor)

Design | Test |
---|---|
Requirements Analysis | Acceptance Tests
System Design | Systems Tests
Architecture Design | Integration Tests
Module Design | Unit Tests

Project:
- Requirements (REQ-001):
  - Epics / Features:
    - User Story:
      - Acceptance Criteria

Template User Story:
As a ...
I would like to ..

Given ...
When ...
Then ...

Pros of TDD:
- Improved quality of code (reduced coupling  / increased cohesion / more SOLID)
- Improved design and architecture
- Easier to maintain
- Easier to adapt to changing requirements

Cons of TDD:
- Slows down development
- Difficult to learn
- Difficult to mix in a non-TDD team
- Doesn't solve every problem

Requirements:
I would like a simple web app that can
calculate player stats for various disc golf courses.

- Can keep score
